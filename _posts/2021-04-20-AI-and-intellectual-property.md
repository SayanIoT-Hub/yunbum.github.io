description: "자율주행관련 Mobile robot 개발자로써 관련 알고리즘 개발, 센서퓨전 테스트 등의 개발을 하는데 있어 크고 무거운 챠량 혹은 로봇등을 사용하는데 어려움을 많이 격게되어 휴대성이 좋고 쉽게 테스트,개발을 할수 있는 플랫폼을 만들게되었습니다."

자율주행 모바일 로봇개발 목적으로 개발한 플랫폼 [reading an article](https://github.com/yunbum/SRC/) .

The project was created by [Over the Bridge](https://overthebridge.org), an organization dedicated to increase awareness on mental health and substance abuse in the music industry, trying to denormalize and remove the glamour around such illnesses within the music community.

They are using Google's [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org), which is a neural network that precisely was conceived to explore the role of machine learning within the creative process. Magenta has been used to create a brand new "Beatles" song or even there was a band that [used it to write a full album](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/yachts-chain-tripping-is-a-new-landmark-for-ai-music-an-album-that-doesnt-suck/) in 2019.

Think about it, imagine one of this new songs becomes a massive hit with millions of youtube views and spotify streams, who can claim the royalties generated?

Now, creative works qualify for copyright protection if they are original, with most definitions of originality requiring a human author.  “register an original work of authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being.” 

So as we currently stand, a human author is required to grant a copyright, which makes sense, there is no point of having a neural network be the beneficiary of royalties of a creative work (no bank would open an account for them anyways, lol).

<small>[The Next SRC](https://github.com/yunbum/SRC) 는 보다 강력한 모터, 주행알고리즘 등으로 개량되어, 커리큘럼 및 예제와 함께 (Python, LabVIEW 등) 모바일 버전으로도 준비중에 있습니다. .</small>
