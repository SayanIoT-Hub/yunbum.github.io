I"u<p>Funnily, this is not my first post. The birth of the blog came very natural as a way to “document” my newly established pursuit for getting myself into Machine Learning. This new adventure of mine comprises several things, and if I want to succeed I need to be serious about them all:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up a blog to document my journey and share it:</li>
  <li>Establish a learning and blogging routine.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the focus areas I will start with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neural Networks fundamentals: history, basic architecture and math behind them</li>
  <li>Deep Neural Networks</li>
</ul>

<p>I selected the above areas to focus on based on my personal interests, I have been fascinated by the developments in reinforcement learning for a long time, in particular <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog">Deep Mind’s</a> awesome <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/innovations-alphago">Go</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go">Chess</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">Starcraft</a> playing agents. Therefore, I started reading a lot about it and even started a personal project for coding a <a href="./deep-q-learning-tic-tac-toe.html">tic-tac-toe learning agent</a>.</p>

<p>As for practical work I decided to start by <a href="./ML-Library-from-scratch.html">coding my first models from scratch</a> (without using libraries such as Tensorflow), to be able to deeply understand the math and logic behind the models, so far it has proven to be priceless.</p>

<p>For my next project I think I will start to do the basic hand-written digits recognition, which is the Machine Learning Hello World, for this I think I will start to use Tensorflow already.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h4 id="static-website-generator">Static Website Generator</h4>
<p>I researched a lot on this, when I started I didn’t even know I needed a static website generator. I was just sure of one thing, I wanted my blog site to look modern, be easy to update and not to have anything extra or additional content or functionality I did not need.</p>

<p>There is a myriad of website generators nowadays, after a lengthy search the ones I ended up considering are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a></li>
  <li><a href="https:webflow.com">webflow</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/static-site-generator/">gatsby</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I started with the web interfaced generators with included hosting in their offerings:</p>

<p>I have tried <a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a> before, they are fantastic for quick and easy website generation, but their free offering has ads, so again, a big no for me.</p>

<p>I discovered <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> as the platform used by one of the bloggers I follow (<a href="https://ruder.io/">Sebastian Ruder</a>), therefore free to use in any hosting.</p>

<p>Next were the generators that don’t have a web interface, but can be easily set up:</p>

<p>I also tested <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/static-site-generator/">gatsby</a> with it’s own Gatsby Cloud hosting service, <a href="https://amaynez.gatsbyjs.io/">here is my test site</a>.</p>

<p>Finally it came self sailing boat</p>
<ol>
  <li>keep it all online, special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> .</li>
  <li>Have a synchronized local copy of the source files for the website.</li>
</ol>

<p>I picked up a template, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SEO meta tags</li>
  <li>Dark mode</li>
  <li>comments ‘courtain’ to mask the disqus interface</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./assets/img/template_screenshots/homepage-responsive.jpg" alt="my new blog" /></p>

<p><img src="./assets/img/template_screenshots/light-toggle.png" alt="night theme toggle" /></p>

<p>As a summary, Hugo and Gatsby might be much faster than Jekyll to build the sites.</p>

<p>You can use the modified template yourself by <a href="https://github.com/the-mvm/the-mvm.github.io/fork/">forking my repository</a>. Let me know in the comments or feel free to contact me if you are interested in a detailed walkthrough on how to <a href="https://github.com/the-mvm/the-mvm.github.io#Installation">set it all up</a>.</p>

<h4 id="hosting">Hosting</h4>
<p>Since I decided on Jekyll to generate my site, the choice for hosting was quite obvious, <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a></strong> is very nicely integrated with it, it is free, and it has no ads! Plus the domain name isn’t too terrible (<a href="https://the-mvm.github.io">the-mvm.github.io</a>).</p>

<h5 id="interplanetary-file-system">Interplanetary File System</h5>
<p>To contribute to and test <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs#quick-summary">IPFS</a> I also set up a <a href="https://weathered-bread-8229.on.fleek.co/">mirror</a> in IPFS by using <a href="https://fleek.co">fleek.co</a>.</p>

<p>But this fix did not work for the search function, because it relies on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search.json</code> file (also generated programmatically to be served as a static file), therefore when generating this file one either use the relative path for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> directory or for a nested directory.</p>
