I"<p>Funnily, this is not my first post. The birth of the blog came very natural as a way to “document” my newly established pursuit for getting myself into Machine Learning. This new adventure of mine comprises several things, and if I want to succeed I need to be serious about them all:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to start coding again! I used to code a long time ago, starting when I was 8 years old in a Tandy Color Computer hooked up to my parent’s TV.</li>
  <li>Machine Learning is a vast, wide subject, I want to learn the generals, but also to select a few areas to focus on.</li>
  <li>Setting up a blog to document my journey and share it:</li>
  <li>Establish a learning and blogging routine. If I don’t do this, I am sure this endeavour will die off soon.</li>
</ul>
